My project is about sharing with gamers and people that are interested with the game "Victoria 3".
It is to encourage people to purchase the game through this website by sharing with them the game's features, design and concept.

## Design Process

This website will be aimed at people that want to know more about the game's features and designs before purchasing it as they want to be informed of what product they are purchasing, and give them access to the purchasing website if they are interested in buying it. Thus while designing the website. I included a home page where I can access other pages and also to introduce to the user what game is this page. Then I will have a page that gives a summary of the game and another page to give more details of the game's features. And after all this if the person is interested in buying it, he or she can go ahead and immediately click a button to go buy it.

User stories:
- As a user type, I want to see how the game is played to know its features

## Features

### Existing Features

- The Dev Diaries button leads to the Dev Diaries page.
